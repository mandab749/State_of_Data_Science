# Kaggle State_of_Data_Science Survey 2019

Project by: Justin Tienken-Harder, Dominic Ventura, and Manda Bucklin  

Using the Kaggle 2019 State_of_Data_Science Survey, we wanted to see what data scientists of different genders, incomes, locations, and years of experience had to say abou the state of affairs in data science.   

We were tasked to create a web-app using Flask on our institution's server. Ultimately, our app allows users to explore the data themselves using graphs and word clouds created in python code. 

# Files
- index.html - our web-app page. The css and js files are not included in this git folder
- views.py - graphs python code in conjuction with Flask
- kaggle_database.py & Word_Cloud_queries.py used for word cloud portion of web-app
